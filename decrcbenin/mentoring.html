            <h3> What are the four functions of mentoring? </h3>
            <div>Kram (1985a) theorized that mentors may provide four psychosocial functions:
                help- ing the protege develop a sense of professional self
                (accep- tance and confirmation),
                <div> providing problem-solving and a sounding board
                    (counseling), giving respect and support (friendship), and providing identification and role
                    modeling.
