            help- ing the protege develop a sense of professional self
            (accep- tance and confirmation),
            <div> providing problem-solving and a sounding board
                (counseling), giving respect and support (friendship), and providing identification and role
                modeling.

                        requirements such as employee evaluation.</div>
