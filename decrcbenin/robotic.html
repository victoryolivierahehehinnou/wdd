    <h2>ROBOTIC</h2>
    <p>
        <div> Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering, and technology. Since the birth of STEM,
            robotics has taken a central place in the practice of STEM education,
            <div>also known as STEM Robotics. Robotics provides a microcosm of technologies that support STEM
                education.
                <div>STEM Robotics helps kids in improving their understanding of
                    <div> problem-solving techniques and overcoming their fear of failure.
                        <div> While developing robotics, children analyze a problem and tried to fix it
                            <div> as simply as possible using robots. Robotics teaches kids to be problem solvers in
                                the
                                real world.
                                <div> ROBOTICS ACADEMY is an educational start-up based gears up to encourage

                                    <div> education in Schools and Colleges . STEM Robotics Provides highly
                                        effective Robotics Education
                                        <div>through its integrated curriculum materials and equipment that engage
                                            and create a passion towards STEM fields
