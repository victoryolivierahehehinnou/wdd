                    <div> Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering, and technology. Since the birth of STEM,
                        robotics has taken a central place in the practice of STEM education,
                        <div>also known as STEM Robotics. Robotics provides a microcosm of technologies that support
                            STEM
                            education.
                            <div>STEM Robotics helps kids in improving their understanding of
                                <div> problem-solving techniques and overcoming their fear of failure.
                                    <div> While developing robotics, children analyze a problem and tried to fix it
                                        <div> as simply as possible using robots. Robotics teaches kids to be problem
