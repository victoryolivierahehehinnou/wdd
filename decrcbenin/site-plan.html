            Why mentoring is so important?
            <div> allows people to learn from one another, providing a path to knowledge transfer.</div>
            <div>In the workplace, for instance, someone established in their career can share knowledge and insights,
            </div>
            <div>well as offer guidance, to someone with less experience.</div>
            <div>trusting mentorship relationship enables honest feedback.
                By establishing trust, the mentee understands that constructive criticism aims to build their
                professional growth rather than make them feel bad.</div>
            <div>can identify weaknesses and advise them on ways to improve.</div>
            <div>those who are being mentored, it is linked to improved academic, social and economic prospects.</div>

            <div>those who are mentoring, the relationship can build leadership and management skills,
                expand a mentor's professional network, and provide an empowering opportunity to give back to the
                community.</div>

            <h3> What are the four functions of mentoring? </h3>
            <div>Kram (1985a) theorized that mentors may provide four psychosocial functions:
                help- ing the protege develop a sense of professional self
                (accep- tance and confirmation),
                <div> providing problem-solving and a sounding board
                    (counseling), giving respect and support (friendship), and providing identification and role
                    modeling.
